# PIFSC refrigerators and freezers
PIFSC has a number of refrigerators, freezers, and other appliances that use refrigerants.  

## Methods
This section describes the methods used to estimate the emissions from PIFSC refrigerant usage, which follow those in the US EPAâ€™s calculator tool.

### Data Gathering, Wrangling, and Assumptions
A list of cold storage units and other appliances that use refrigeration was provided by Kerry Reardon (Kerry.Reardon@noaa.gov).  This information is accessible via Google Drive and a copy has been added to our Data folder as both a Google Sheet and Excel spreadsheet (to make analysis easier).

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Set environment
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(here)

```

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Load data
Refrigerators <- read_xlsx(here("Data", "Copy of List of cold storage units and large appliances 2024.07.30.xlsx"), 
                           sheet = "Cold Storage")
Reefers_with <- filter(Refrigerators, !is.na(Refrigerant))

MiscApps <- read_xlsx(here("Data", "Copy of List of cold storage units and large appliances 2024.07.30.xlsx"), 
                           sheet = "MISC large appliances")
MiscApps_with <- MiscApps |> filter(if_all(everything(), ~!is.na(Refrigerant)))
```
